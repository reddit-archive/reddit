      <!--
       ~ ColumnFamily definitions have one required attribute (Name)
       ~ and several optional ones.
       ~
       ~ The CompareWith attribute tells Cassandra how to sort the columns
       ~ for slicing operations.  The default is BytesType, which is a
       ~ straightforward lexical comparison of the bytes in each column.
       ~ Other options are AsciiType, UTF8Type, LexicalUUIDType, TimeUUIDType,
       ~ and LongType.  You can also specify the fully-qualified class
       ~ name to a class of your choice extending
       ~ org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.
       ~ 
       ~ SuperColumns have a similar CompareSubcolumnsWith attribute.
       ~ 
       ~ BytesType: Simple sort by byte value.  No validation is performed.
       ~ AsciiType: Like BytesType, but validates that the input can be 
       ~            parsed as US-ASCII.
       ~ UTF8Type: A string encoded as UTF8
       ~ LongType: A 64bit long
       ~ LexicalUUIDType: A 128bit UUID, compared lexically (by byte value)
       ~ TimeUUIDType: a 128bit version 1 UUID, compared by timestamp
       ~
       ~ (To get the closest approximation to 0.3-style supercolumns, you
       ~ would use CompareWith=UTF8Type CompareSubcolumnsWith=LongType.)
       ~
       ~ An optional `Comment` attribute may be used to attach additional
       ~ human-readable information about the column family to its definition.
       ~ 
       ~ The optional KeysCached attribute specifies
       ~ the number of keys per sstable whose locations we keep in
       ~ memory in "mostly LRU" order.  (JUST the key locations, NOT any
       ~ column values.) Specify a fraction (value less than 1), a percentage
       ~ (ending in a % sign) or an absolute number of keys to cache.
       ~ KeysCached defaults to 200000 keys.
       ~
       ~ The optional RowsCached attribute specifies the number of rows
       ~ whose entire contents we cache in memory. Do not use this on
       ~ ColumnFamilies with large rows, or ColumnFamilies with high write:read
       ~ ratios. Specify a fraction (value less than 1), a percentage (ending in
       ~ a % sign) or an absolute number of rows to cache. 
       ~ RowsCached defaults to 0, i.e., row cache is off by default.

       ~ Remember, when using caches as a percentage, they WILL grow with
       ~ your data set!
