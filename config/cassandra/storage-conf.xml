   ~ milliseconds for other writes, before performing the sync.

   ~ This is less necessary in Cassandra than in traditional databases
   ~ since replication reduces the odds of losing data from a failure
   ~ after writing the log entry but before it actually reaches the disk.
   ~ So the other option is "periodic," where writes may be acked immediately
   ~ and the CommitLog is simply synced every CommitLogSyncPeriodInMS
   ~ milliseconds.
