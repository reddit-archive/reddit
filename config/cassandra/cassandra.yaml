# You should always specify InitialToken when setting up a production
# cluster for the first time, and often when adding capacity later.
# The principle is that each node should be given an equal slice of
# the token ring; see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations
# for more details.
#
# If blank, Cassandra will request a token bisecting the range of
# the heaviest-loaded existing node.  If there is no load information
# available, such as is the case with a new cluster, it will pick
# a random token, which will lead to hot spots.
initial_token:

# Set to true to make new [non-seed] nodes automatically migrate data
# to themselves from the pre-existing nodes in the cluster.  Defaults
# to false because you can only bootstrap N machines at a time from
# an existing cluster of N, so if you are bringing up a cluster of
# 10 machines with 3 seeds you would have to do it in stages.  Leaving
# this off for the initial start simplifies that.

# The partitioner is responsible for distributing rows (by key) across
# nodes in the cluster.  Any IPartitioner may be used, including your
# own as long as it is on the classpath.  Out of the box, Cassandra
# provides org.apache.cassandra.dht.RandomPartitioner
# org.apache.cassandra.dht.ByteOrderedPartitioner,
# org.apache.cassandra.dht.OrderPreservingPartitioner (deprecated),
# and org.apache.cassandra.dht.CollatingOrderPreservingPartitioner
# (deprecated).
# 
# - RandomPartitioner distributes rows across the cluster evenly by md5.
#   When in doubt, this is the best option.
# - ByteOrderedPartitioner orders rows lexically by key bytes.  BOP allows
#   scanning rows in key order, but the ordering can generate hot spots
#   for sequential insertion workloads.
# - OrderPreservingPartitioner is an obsolete form of BOP, that stores
# - keys in a less-efficient format and only works with keys that are
#   UTF8-encoded Strings.
# - CollatingOPP colates according to EN,US rules rather than lexical byte
#   ordering.  Use this as an example if you need custom collation.
#
# See http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations for more on
# partitioners and token selection.

# endpoint_snitch -- Set this to a class that implements

# Out of the box, Cassandra provides

#    Treats Strategy order as proximity. This improves cache locality
#    when disabling read repair, which can further improve throughput.
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.RackInferringSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    assumed to correspond to the 3rd and 2nd octet of each node's
#    IP address, respectively
# org.apache.cassandra.locator.PropertyFileSnitch:

# request_scheduler -- Set this to a class that implements
# RequestScheduler, which will schedule incoming client requests
# according to the specific policy. This is useful for multi-tenancy
# with a single Cassandra cluster.
# NOTE: This is specifically for requests from the client and does
# not affect inter node communication.
# org.apache.cassandra.scheduler.NoScheduler - No scheduling takes place
# org.apache.cassandra.scheduler.RoundRobinScheduler - Round robin of
# client requests to a node with a separate queue for each
# request_scheduler_id. The scheduler is further customized by
# request_scheduler_options as described below.
request_scheduler: org.apache.cassandra.scheduler.NoScheduler

# Scheduler Options vary based on the type of scheduler
# NoScheduler - Has no options
# RoundRobin
#  - throttle_limit -- The throttle_limit is the number of in-flight
#                      requests per client.  Requests beyond 
#                      that limit are queued up until
#                      running requests can complete.
#                      The value of 80 here is twice the number of
#                      concurrent_reads + concurrent_writes.
#  - default_weight -- default_weight is optional and allows for
#                      overriding the default which is 1.
#  - weights -- Weights are optional and will default to 1 or the
#               overridden default_weight. The weight translates into how
#               many requests are handled during each turn of the
#               RoundRobin, based on the scheduler id.
#
# request_scheduler_options:

# The Index Interval determines how large the sampling of row keys
#  is for a given SSTable. The larger the sampling, the more effective
#  the index is at the cost of space.
index_interval: 128

# Keyspaces have ColumnFamilies.        (Usually 1 KS per application.)
# ColumnFamilies have Rows.             (Dozens of CFs per KS.)
# Rows contain Columns.                 (Many per CF.)
# Columns contain name:value:timestamp. (Many per Row.)
#
# A KS is most similar to a schema, and a CF is most similar to a relational table.
#
# Keyspaces, ColumnFamilies, and Columns may carry additional
# metadata that change their behavior. These are as follows:
#
# Keyspace required parameters:
# - name: name of the keyspace; "system" is
#   reserved for Cassandra Internals.
# - replica_placement_strategy: the class that determines how replicas
#   are distributed among nodes. Contains both the class as well as
#   configuration information.  Must extend AbstractReplicationStrategy.
#   Out of the box, Cassandra provides 
#     * org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy 
#     * org.apache.cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy
#     * org.apache.cassandra.locator.OldNetworkTopologyStrategy
#
#   SimpleStrategy merely places the first
#   replica at the node whose token is closest to the key (as determined
#   by the Partitioner), and additional replicas on subsequent nodes
#   along the ring in increasing Token order.
# 
#   With NetworkTopologyStrategy,
#   for each datacenter, you can specify how many replicas you want
#   on a per-keyspace basis.  Replicas are placed on different racks
#   within each DC, if possible. This strategy also requires rack aware
#   snitch, such as RackInferringSnitch or PropertyFileSnitch.
#   An example:
#    - name: Keyspace1
#      replica_placement_strategy: org.apache.cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy
#      strategy_options:
#        DC1 : 3
#        DC2 : 2
#        DC3 : 1
# 
#   OldNetworkToplogyStrategy [formerly RackAwareStrategy] 
#   places one replica in each of two datacenters, and the third on a
#   different rack in in the first.  Additional datacenters are not
#   guaranteed to get a replica.  Additional replicas after three are placed
#   in ring order after the third without regard to rack or datacenter.
# - replication_factor: Number of replicas of each row
# Keyspace optional paramaters:
# - strategy_options: Additional information for the replication strategy.
# - column_families:
#     ColumnFamily required parameters:
#     - name: name of the ColumnFamily.  Must not contain the character "-".
#     - compare_with: tells Cassandra how to sort the columns for slicing
#       operations. The default is BytesType, which is a straightforward
#       lexical comparison of the bytes in each column.  Other options are
#       AsciiType, UTF8Type, LexicalUUIDType, TimeUUIDType, LongType,
#       and IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type).
#       You can also specify the fully-qualified class name to a class of
#       your choice extending org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.
#    
#     ColumnFamily optional parameters:
#     - keys_cached: specifies the number of keys per sstable whose
#        locations we keep in memory in "mostly LRU" order.  (JUST the key
#        locations, NOT any column values.) Specify a fraction (value less
#        than 1) or an absolute number of keys to cache.  Defaults to 200000
#        keys.
#     - rows_cached: specifies the number of rows whose entire contents we
#        cache in memory. Do not use this on ColumnFamilies with large rows,
#        or ColumnFamilies with high write:read ratios. Specify a fraction
#        (value less than 1) or an absolute number of rows to cache.
#        Defaults to 0. (i.e. row caching is off by default)
#     - comment: used to attach additional human-readable information about 
#        the column family to its definition.
#     - read_repair_chance: specifies the probability with which read
#        repairs should be invoked on non-quorum reads.  must be between 0
#        and 1. defaults to 1.0 (always read repair).
#     - gc_grace_seconds: specifies the time to wait before garbage
#        collecting tombstones (deletion markers). defaults to 864000 (10
#        days). See http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DistributedDeletes
#     - default_validation_class: specifies a validator class to use for
#        validating all the column values in the CF.
#     NOTE:
#     min_ must be less than max_compaction_threshold!
#     - min_compaction_threshold: the minimum number of SSTables needed
#        to start a minor compaction.  increasing this will cause minor
#        compactions to start less frequently and be more intensive. setting
#        this to 0 disables minor compactions.  defaults to 4.
#     - max_compaction_threshold: the maximum number of SSTables allowed
#        before a minor compaction is forced.  decreasing this will cause
#        minor compactions to start more frequently and be less intensive.
#        setting this to 0 disables minor compactions.  defaults to 32.
#     /NOTE
#     - row_cache_save_period_in_seconds: number of seconds between saving
#        row caches.  The row caches can be saved periodically and if one
#        exists on startup it will be loaded.
#     - key_cache_save_period_in_seconds: number of seconds between saving
#        key caches.  The key caches can be saved periodically and if one 
#        exists on startup it will be loaded.
#     - memtable_flush_after_mins: The maximum time to leave a dirty table
#        unflushed.  This should be large enough that it won't cause a flush
#        storm of all memtables during periods of inactivity.
#     - memtable_throughput_in_mb: The maximum size of the memtable before
#        it is flushed.  If undefined, 1/8 * heapsize will be used.
#     - memtable_operations_in_millions: Number of operations in millions
#        before the memtable is flushed. If undefined, throughput / 64 * 0.3
#        will be used.
#     - column_metadata:
#         Column required parameters:
#         - name: binds a validator (and optionally an indexer) to columns 
#            with this name in any row of the enclosing column family.
#         - validator: like cf.compare_with, an AbstractType that checks
#            that the value of the column is well-defined.
#         Column optional parameters:
#         NOTE:
#         index_name cannot be set if index_type is not also set!
#         - index_name: User-friendly name for the index.
#         - index_type: The type of index to be created. Currently only
#            KEYS is supported.
#         /NOTE
# 
# NOTE:
#   this keyspace definition is for demonstration purposes only.
#   Cassandra will not load these definitions during startup. See
#   http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/FAQ#no_keyspaces for an explanation.
