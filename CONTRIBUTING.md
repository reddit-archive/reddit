Thanks for wanting to help make reddit better!

Before you submit an issue or pull request, please keep in mind a couple of
considerations:

1. **Don't use github issues for feature requests**.
If you have a feature request, please submit it to
[/r/ideasfortheadmins](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins) instead.
Please note that while we do subscribe to /r/ideasfortheadmins, the presence
of a response or lack thereof has no indication as to whether the idea will
actually get implemented.

2. **Don't submit unconfirmed bugs**.
Please make sure your bug is an actual bug before reporting it.
Unfortunately, things will sometimes break on the operations side of the site.
(e.g. a database slowing down, or a server being unavailable) These issues may
look like a bug, but they are not.  If you're not sure, make a post in
[/r/bugs](http://www.reddit.com/r/bugs).

3. Please adhere to our [coding
standards](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki#change-reddit).

After you submit your issue or request, we'll take a look and it and get back
to you in a few days. If you have any questions, feel free to ask us! We're
readily available:

* [/r/redditdev](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev)
* [reddit-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/reddit-dev)
* [#reddit-dev](irc://irc.freenode.net/reddit-dev) on [freenode](http://www.freenode.net/).
Remember to use [proper IRC etiquette](http://geoff.greer.fm/2012/05/19/programmer-irc-etiquette/).
